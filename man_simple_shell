simple_shell - Simple command interpreter (shell)

SYNOPSIS
simple_shell [file]

DESCRIPTION
Simple Shell is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.

ARGUMENTS
The only argument that should be supplied to the shell is the name of a file. When this happens, the shell reads and executes commands from this file, then exits.

SHELL GRAMMAR
- A simple command is a sequence of blank-separated words that are terminated by a control operator.
- The return value of a simple command is its exit status or 128+n if the command is terminated by signal n.

COMMENTS
- A word beginning with a # causes that word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored.

QUOTING
- Single quotes preserve the literal meaning of characters within them.
- Double quotes preserve the literal meaning of characters except for the dollar sign ($).

ALIASES
- An alias is a name and corresponding value set using the alias builtin command.
